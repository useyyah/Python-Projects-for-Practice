You are the world-famous detective Mathilde Camus.
ZOPHIE THE CAT has gone missing, and you must sift through the clues.
Suspects either always tell lies, or always tell the truth. Ask them
about other people, places, and items to see if the details they give are
truthful and consistent with your observations. The you will know if
their clue about ZOPHIE THE CAT is true or not. Will you find ZOPHIE THE
CAT in time and accuse the guilty party?
